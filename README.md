✂️ The material obtained was passed through Adobe Audition to change the speech timing.

👩🏼 Using D-ID, the audio was transformed into the video presentation made by the virtual avatar.

🖼️ To improve the content, excerpts from the text were chosen to be transformed into drawings on Runway.

🖌️ Still on Runway, the images obtained were transformed into animations.

🎶 The soundtrack was created using Beatoven.ai and was also tweaked in Adobe Audition.
